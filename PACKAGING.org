How to make a release of SNaCK

* Package in Pip
See
https://hynek.me/articles/sharing-your-labor-of-love-pypi-quick-and-dirty/
for a great tutorial.
** DONE Set Metadata (version numbers, etc)
** DONE Test on OSX
conda uninstall snack
pip uninstall snack
rm -r build snack/_snack.so
pip install .

** DONE Test on Linux
* DONE Upload to PyPI
See helpful instructions! https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing/#setup-py
- Made a PyPI account, mjw25
- python setup.py register

To upload a source package:
- python setup.py sdist
- twine upload dist/*

** What about distributing binary wheels?
This is difficult.
- I have to switch from 'distutils' to 'setuptools'
- When I do this, setuptools by default installs everything as a
  single .egg file, which is a zip file. It puts this in
  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages. Ugh.

** TODO Make a test script
import snack
import numpy as np
snack.snack_embed(np.random.randn(500, 5), 1000.0,
                  np.random.randint(500, size=(5000, 3)), 1.0)
** DONE Need a README

* DONE Package in Conda
*** How to use Conda
On a fresh machine, install Conda:
: wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
: bash Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
: . .bashrc

Install anaconda-client:
: conda install anaconda-client

Install git and build-essential

Edit meta.yml to bump version number and deps:
: vi conda-build-files/meta.yml

Make SURE that build files are GONE, this will mess up your anaconda
package!
: rm -r build snack/*.so snack/*.cpp

Build in Conda:
: conda build conda-build-files/

Output:
: # If you want to upload this package to anaconda.org later, type:
: #
: # $ anaconda upload /Users/michael/local/miniconda/conda-bld/osx-64/snack-0.0.2-nppy27_0.tar.bz2
: #
: # To have conda build upload to anaconda.org automatically, use
: # $ conda config --set anaconda_upload yes

This saves the build file in a local repository in ~miniconda/conda-bld.

To install locally:
: conda build --use_local snack

To upload with Anaconda:
: anaconda upload /Users/michael/local/miniconda/conda-bld/osx-64/snack-0.0.2-nppy27_0.tar.bz2

To install from Anaconda (test on a fresh machine)
: conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/gcr snack


*** DONE Adjust metadata (version numbers, etc)
*** DONE Build on linux
*** DONE Build on OSX
** TODO Write some examples.
